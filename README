= EMaily

== DESCRIPTION
EMaily is a CLI tool caplable of sending multiple templated emails using different mail server. It is part of a bigger social Enginering Framework I'm creating which involves ( ESearchy-ng, ETwitty, etc ..)

NOTE: THIS IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED CODE IS SUBMITTED DAILY SO BE AWARE THAT CODE MIGHT NOT WORK PROPERLY AL THE TIME. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG PLEASE RAISE AN ISSUE.  


== SUPPORT:

* http://github.com/FreedomCoder/emaily/issues
* Emails from github.

== SYNOPSIS:

For now, the tools is not interactive, but it is still as simple as one line command to send millons of emails in one click.

EMAILY COMMANDS:

	emaily -S gmail,hotmail --subject "Testing EMaily" -t templates/test_template.html -l ~/emails.csv --webserver --scanports 80,443,8080,8443,35000  -a cv.docx -b 10 --thread

This line will send 10 emails at a time using two different smtp configurations ( gmail and hotmail) with the subject "Testing Emaily" and using the testing template. The email list will be populated from a csv file, which also is used to generate each individual email. Short of that, it will also create a simple web server that will listen for incomming connection and it will scan the required ports.  


TEMPLATES:

<subject>EMaily Test Email</subject>  // optional
<html>
	<body>
		<h1> Hello %%name%% </h1>
		
		I'm testing this email: %%email%%
